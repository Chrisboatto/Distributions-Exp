**Lab 6**

Lab 6 in the CMTH 642 course at Ryerson University was designed to teach aspiring data scientist how to determine which distributions that were taught to use with each question. A key component to becoming a  data scientist is knowing which distribution or what tools to use to solve problems. Some problems require simple linear models and distributions but some tasks require more complex models such as Random Forest. In this lab we will review what models are used to complete each task.

To begin I would recommend reading the PDF file that explains each question and why it is done.
